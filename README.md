# API_Development_for_IPL_data_queries
I have created APIs for Players Names, Players Info, Teams Names and Team vs Team stats.

Usage:
Run app.py file
Website will get open
In the URL section after the IP address append /api/teams to fetch teams names of all teams played in IPL.
In the URL section after the IP address append /api/teamvteam?team1=team1_name&team2=team2_name to fetch team1 vs team2 stats.
In the URL section after the IP address append /api/players to get player names of top 150 players played in IPL.
In the URL section after the IP address append /api/player_info?name=player_name to get stats of the player.
